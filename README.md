View the output of your .docx LIVE in your browser while you are coding it using [docx.js](https://docx.js.org/).

[Getting started](#getting-started)

## Description

Working with [docx.js](https://github.com/dolanmiu/docx) can be painful without viewing the output of your code in
real-time. I created this project to help you work with [docx.js](https://docx.js.org/) in order to code word documents
easily. It offers a viewer for your .docx file, and a live preview of your code in real-time.
